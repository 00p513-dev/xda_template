[center][b][color=#c10300][size=5]This is a development alpha release, so there will be bugs. [/size][/color][/b][/center]

[center][b][color=#000000]If you have a major bug to report that has not been reported already, please take the following steps to report it to us.  It will save you and our team quite some time.[/color][/b][/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]Download the [url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat&hl=en][color=DeepSkyBlue][u]Catlog[/u][/color][/url] app from the Play Store.[/b][/color][/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]There is also a donate version which you can purchase to show appreciation.[/b][/color][/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]After downloading the Catlog app, go to the app settings, and change the log level to Debug.[/b][/color][/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]Clear all previous logs and take the exact steps to produce the error you are receiving.[/b][/color][/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]As soon as you receive the error (probably a force close), go straight into Catlog and stop the log recording.
Manual Logging: Use the alt-f1 console, and in the console, type:
[/b]
[/color]
[code]logcat > sdcard/log_name.txt[/code]
[/center]
[center][color=#000000][b]Then alt-f7 to get back to the Android UI, and replacate the issue. When done, use alt-f1 to go back to console and ctrl-c to stop the logging.

Copy and paste the entire log either to [url=http://hastebin.com][color=DeepSkyBlue][u]Hastebin[/u][/color][/url] or [url=http://pastebin.com][color=DeepSkyBlue][u]Pastebin[/u][/color][/url][/b][/color][/center]
